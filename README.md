# Spine-Tool

**Introduction**


The purpose of this tool is to use machine learning techniques for predicting the clinical outcomes on improvement in VAS, MOD and NCOS based on the managements like Spinal decompression without fusion (open discectomy/ Laminectomy), Spinal compression with fusion, and Conservative Management.


**GUI Tool**


A GUI tool was built to take input details of patients like Sex, BMI and other primary inputs. The doctor can select the initial management used, based on the inputs the model predicts the improvement in all 3 indices based on Management. Further the doctor can change the type of management used and see the difference in the improvement in the indices and find the best suitable management for the particular patient. The tool can assist doctors to select the best management practice that a patient can undergo in order to achieve best improvement results.
